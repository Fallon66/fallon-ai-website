## Design Style Principles

### 1. Clean & Minimalist
- White space is your friend
- Don't overcrowd designs
- One clear focal point per graphic

### 2. ADHD-Friendly
- Scannable content (bullet points, short sentences)
- Visual hierarchy (big headers, clear sections)
- Not overwhelming (limit to 3-5 key points max)
- Use color to guide attention

### 3. Tech-Forward but Human
- Modern, clean aesthetic (not corporate/stuffy)
- Friendly tone (approachable, not intimidating)
- Glassmorphism OK (subtle transparency effects)
- Rounded corners preferred over sharp angles

### 4. Professional but Playful
- Cute octopus mascot balanced with serious capability
- Can be slightly quirky (Charlotte's personality)
- Anti-corporate vibes (authentic, not polished to death)
- OK to show personality and humor

---

## Logo Usage

### Primary Logo
- Cute teal octopus with coral gradient tentacles
- "Fallon AI" in Poppins Bold beside octopus
- Horizontal layout (side-by-side)

### Logo Variations
1. **Full logo:** Octopus + text (primary use)
2. **Icon only:** Just octopus (social media profiles, favicon)
3. **Text only:** "Fallon AI" in Poppins Bold (when space limited)

### Logo Don'ts
- Don't stretch or distort the octopus

## Voice & Tone

### How Fallon AI Sounds

**Casual UK English:**
- "Realised" not "realized"
- "Whilst" not "while"
- Occasional British phrases

**Honest & Vulnerable:**
- "Amalgamated brain of mess" (relatable)
- "Am I onto something or losing my mind?"
- Share struggles, not just wins

**Anti-Corporate:**
- "Dumping systems" not "deploying solutions"
- No jargon ("synergy," "leverage")
- No guru vibes ("I have the answer!")

**Self-Aware:**
- Acknowledge neurodivergence openly
- Embrace the chaos while building systems
- Champion "the little guy"

### Words to Use
- Transform, clarity, breathing room
- Chaos, overwhelm, survival mode
- Guinea pig, experiment, build in public
- Octopus, ADHD, neurodivergent
- Quick win, deep dive, bespoke

### Words to Avoid
- Synergy, leverage, disrupt
- Guru, thought leader (unless ironic)
- Enterprise, corporate speak
- Perfect, flawless, expert (use "top 5%" instead)

## Content Guidelines for Graphics

### Headlines (Main Message)
- 5-10 words max
- Start with number or "How to" when possible
- Use Charlotte's voice (conversational)
- Examples:

  - "Why ADHD is an AI superpower"
  - "I built 15 custom commands for my brain"

### Supporting Text
- 15-30 words

- Keep it scannable

### Footer/Attribution

### Bad Example
